## Libraries
```{r}
# Loading packages for being able to manipulate and plot spatial data
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
```

## Data
```{r}
# Reading in the Former Municipality Boundaries Data GeoJson file and reprojecting
fmbd <- st_read('data/Former Municipality Boundaries Data.geojson') %>% st_transform(3857)

# Reading in the Community Shelters shapefile and reprojecting
shelters <- st_read("data/Shelter/shelters_wgs84.shp") %>% st_transform(3857)

# Reading in the Neighbourhoods GeoJson File and reprojecting
ngh <- st_read("data/Neighbourhoods.geojson") %>% st_transform(3857)

# Reading in the Neighbourhood Improvement Areas GeoJson File and reprojecting
ngh_imp <- st_read("data/Neighbourhood Improvement Areas.geojson") %>% st_transform(3857)
``` 

## Functions
### Buffer and spatial join function
```{r}
buffer_sjoin <- function(gdf1, gdf2, dist = 1000){
  
  #'Buffers geodataframe 1 and joins it to the nearest geometries in geodataframe 2.
  #'@param gdf1 A geodataframe with points.
  #'@param gdf2 A geodataframe with polygons.
  #'@param dist Buffer distance to apply. Default is 1000.
  #'
  #'@return The geodataframe after applying a buffer to gdf1 and joining to geometries of gdf2.
  
  
  # Buffer gdf1 by dist
  gdf1_buff <- st_buffer(gdf1, dist)
  
  # Join the geometries of gdf2 with buffered gdf1
  result <- st_join(gdf1_buff, gdf2)
  return(result)
}
```

### Spatial join and count function
```{r}
buffer_sjoin <- function(gdf1, gdf2, dist = 1000){
  
  #'Takes geodataframe 2 and joins it to the geometries in geodataframe 1, then counts the number of points from      geodataframe 2.
  #'@param gdf1 A geodataframe with points.
  #'@param gdf2 A geodataframe with polygons.
  #'
  #'@return The geodataframe after joining gdf1 and gdf2 and counting the number of points from gdf2.
  
  
  # Buffer gdf1 by dist
  gdf1_buff <- st_buffer(gdf1, dist)
  
  # Join the geometries of gdf2 with buffered gdf1
  result <- st_join(gdf1_buff, gdf2)
  return(result)
}
```


### Buffer_sjoin demo
Demo
```{r}
# Join shelters and fmbd together after buffering shelters
# Note the default distance is 1000, but it can be changed
# e.g. buffer_sjoin(shelters, fmbd, dist = 100) for a 100 meter buffer
buffer_sjoin_shelters_fmbd <- buffer_sjoin(shelters, fmbd)
```

Display non-spatial data
```{r}
# Showing non-spatial results of buffer_sjoin
buffer_sjoin_shelters_fmbd
```

Display spatial data
```{r}
plot(st_geometry(buffer_sjoin_shelters_fmbd))
```
